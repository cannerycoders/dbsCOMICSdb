## For Comic Collectors

![db'sCOMICScollector](dbsCOMICSdbCollector.png?raw=true "dbsCOMICScollector") 
is a desktop and mobile app that helps you keep track of 
one or more comic _collections_. You can share collections with 
friends and with your favorite comic stores via a convenient, open 
database file-format (JSON).  Once you've populated a collection-database 
with issues as well as location and grading/value information, you 
can browse your data without access to an internet connection.  This 
is especially helpful when you're trying to remember what issues you 
are missing while in the warm, bunker-like atmosphere of your friendly 
neighborhood comic store.
